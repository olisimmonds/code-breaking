    "In this Tutorial we begin by designing and implementing functions for enciphering and deciphering messages with one of the original (but now highly insecure) cipher systems, the Caesar Cipher. We then see how to reimplement the RSA protocol for signature/authentication of messages. Finally, in a bonus question, that you can complete in your own time, we look at another instance of encoding and decoding of data in Python. (This time instead of strings/texts we encode finite sets of integers.) \n",

    "Suppose that we have an alphabet of letters/characters in which to write a message. For example suppose that our alphabet consists of the 27 lower case letters of the our usual alphabet and the space character `' '`. In Python we can think of the alphabet as  a string of characters and, of course assign it a name \n",
    "```python\n",
    "ALPH_1 = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz '\n",
    "``` \n",
    "so that every letter is associated with its index in ALPH_1. For example `0` and `4` correspond to `ALPH_1[0]` which is `a` and `ALPH_1[4]` which is `e`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now we want to be able to encipher any message using our alphabet of 27 letters by a circular shift which we can choose to be any integer in the interval $[0,26]$. For example, suppose that we choose shift 3, then the enciphering process corresponds to `'a'` $\\mapsto$ `'d'`, `'b'` $\\mapsto$ `'e'`, $\\dots$ , `'x'` $\\mapsto$ `' '`, `'y'` $\\mapsto$ `'a'`, `'z'` $\\mapsto$ `'b'`, `' '` $\\mapsto$ `'c'`.

The sender and the receiver would both know the shift used and, given the state of Mathematical knowledge at the time,  anyone intercepting the message would have very no idea of how to decipher it. (With modern tools this is very easy...) \n",

    "Your task in this question is to design functions that encipher and decipher messages using the **Caesar cipher** method just described. To do this you will first define functions that perform the shift map and its inverse on individual characters. We begin by defining two different alphabets for use by our functions. \n"

    "## Bonus Question 3: encoding and decoding finite sets \n",
    "\n",
    "In Lecture 9.2  you saw how to encode and decode text messages (i.e. strings in python) as integers. Similar methods have a long history in the study of the algorithmic content of mathematics. For example, a core ingredient in the proofs of Godel's incompleteness theorems published in 1931 - which showed the inherent limitations of any effectively enumerated axiomatic system which is strong enough to model basic arithmetic - was the ability to encode formulae, sentences and proofs of axiomatic systems as integers. Likewise Turing's development of a universal Turing machine in 1936 relied on the fact that every Turing program - which you can think of as just a Python program in our present context - can be uniquely encoded (and so also decoded) as an integer. A standard way to define such coding methods is to firstly define a computable bijective pairing function \n",
    "$p : \\mathbb{N} \\times \\mathbb{N} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{N}$ and then derive from this a computable bijective function that maps sequences (of integers) to integers. \n",
